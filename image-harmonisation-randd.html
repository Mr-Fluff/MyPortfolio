              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                During my internship at ML Research Labs, I had the opportunity to contribute to the Image Harmonisation project. In this project, we aimed to enhance the process of blending foreground and background elements in image editing, creating realistic and visually appealing composite images. Let's explore the key aspects of the project and the outcomes it has achieved.

              <h2>What is Image Harmonisation?</h2>
              <p>
                Image Harmonisation is a crucial post-processing step in image editing that focuses on seamlessly blending foreground and background elements. By effectively combining these elements, we can create composite images that appear natural and visually coherent.
